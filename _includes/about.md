Hi! I am an Applied Research Scientist at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/), working in the Spatial Perception Team. I work primarily in the field of 3D scene understanding, using deep learning methods. Specifically, my research involves adressing the scarcity of manually labelled 3D data through alternative learning approaches. This has resulted in several publications, developing novel weakly and self-supervised learning pipelines for image, point cloud and geometric mesh data. Prior to Apple I was a Senior Research Scientist at [Fujitsu Research of Europe](https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/about/local/corporate/subsidiaries/fle/). 

I am currently completing a Ph.D in 3D computer vision at UCL, London. I am supervised by [Dr. Jan Boehm](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/people/dr-jan-boehm) and have collaborated closely with [Prof. Tobias Ritschel](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/). I spent the summer of 2021 at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/research/) as an intern in the Creative Intelligence Lab, London. Whilst there I worked on geometrically-driven single-image relighting, supervised by [Dr. Julien Philip](https://julienphilip.com/). Our work will be presented at EuroGraphics 2022.
