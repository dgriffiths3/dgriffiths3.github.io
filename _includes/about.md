Iâ€™m a Senior Applied Scientist at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) where I work on Apple Intelligence, Visual Intelligence, and contribute to the Apple Foundation Model (AFM). My work centers on multimodal foundation models and their deployment in real-world applications, with expertise in 3D and multimodal scene understanding. I build advanced AI systems that integrate vision, language, and spatial reasoning.

Previously, I addressed the challenge of limited labeled 3D data by developing weakly and self-supervised learning pipelines for images, point clouds, and geometric meshes, resulting in several publications. Before joining Apple, I was a Senior Research Scientist at [Fujitsu Research of Europe](https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/about/local/corporate/subsidiaries/fle/).

I hold a Ph.D. in 3D computer vision from UCL, London, supervised by [Prof. Jan Boehm](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/people/dr-jan-boehm), with close collaboration with [Prof. Tobias Ritschel](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/). In summer 2021, I interned at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/research/) in the Creative Intelligence Lab, working on geometrically-driven single-image relighting under [Dr. Julien Philip](https://julienphilip.com/).
