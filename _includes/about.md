Hi! I'm an Applied Research Scientist at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/). I work primarily in the field of 3D scene understanding, using deep learning methods. My previous research involved adressing the scarcity of manually labelled 3D data through alternative learning approaches. This resulted in several publications, developing novel weakly and self-supervised learning pipelines for image, point cloud and geometric mesh data. Prior to Apple I was a Senior Research Scientist at [Fujitsu Research of Europe](https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/about/local/corporate/subsidiaries/fle/). 

I completed a Ph.D in 3D computer vision at UCL, London, where I was supervised by [Dr. Jan Boehm](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/people/dr-jan-boehm) and collaborated closely with [Prof. Tobias Ritschel](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/). I spent the summer of 2021 at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/research/) as an intern in the Creative Intelligence Lab, London. Whilst there I worked on [geometrically-driven single-image relighting](/outcast), supervised by [Dr. Julien Philip](https://julienphilip.com/).
